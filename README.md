## üß† Project Overview

**RAID** (Responses to Affine Image Distortions) is a perceptual image quality database built from human judgments. Unlike traditional databases focused on digital distortions, RAID investigates suprathreshold **affine transformations** ‚Äî **rotation, translation, scaling**, and **Gaussian noise** ‚Äî which are more representative of distortions encountered in natural viewing conditions.

Subjective responses were collected using the psychophysical method **Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS)**. Over **40,000 image comparisons** were performed by **210 human observers** under controlled laboratory conditions.

## üìä What‚Äôs in the Database?

- **888 images**: 24 reference images + 864 distorted versions.
- **4 types of distortion**:
  - Rotation (up to ¬±18¬∞)
  - Translation (up to 0.63¬∞ visual angle)
  - Scaling (up to ¬±9%)
  - Gaussian noise (matched with TID2013 levels)
- **MLDS curves**: Quantify perceptual difference as a function of distortion level.
- **Reaction times**: Provide additional validation via Pi√©ron‚Äôs law.

---

## üß™ Technical Validation

Our dataset was validated at multiple levels:
1. Reproduction of **absolute detection thresholds** for each distortion type.
2. Compliance with **Pi√©ron‚Äôs law** (reaction time vs. task difficulty).
3. Alignment with **existing databases** (TID2013), and improved performance as shown through **Group-MAD** experiments.

## üß™ Experimental Design & Results

### üëÅÔ∏è Example Trial: MLDS Psychophysical Task

In each trial, participants were shown **two pairs of images** (quadruple display): one pair on the left and one on the right. Their task was to **choose the pair that showed a larger perceptual difference**. Each trial involved 4 distorted versions of the same reference image, and trials were designed to balance difficulty and prevent trivial answers.

![Figure 2: Example of an MLDS trial setup](Figures/figure_2_example_trial.png)

A total of **210 observers** completed over **40,000 trials**, under controlled lighting conditions and consistent viewing distance. Reaction times were recorded for every decision, providing insight into perceptual processing.

### üìà  MLDS Response Curves

The following figure shows the perceptual response curves for each distortion type (**rotation**, **translation**, **scaling**, and **Gaussian noise**), computed using the **Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS)** method.

</p>

As distortion level increases:
- **Affine distortions** (rotation, translation, scaling) show an approximately **linear perceptual response**.
- **Gaussian noise** exhibits a **saturating response**, aligning with established perceptual models.
